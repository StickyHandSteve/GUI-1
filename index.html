        <h1>The AC/DC Wars</h1>
        
        <p>   &emsp;During the late 1800's a secret war lingered in America.
        This war was about the use of either Alternating Electrical 
        Current or Direct Electrical Current. 

        This altrecation occured between two proponents of each of their respected inventions. Thomas Edison
        being a main supporter of DC Current and George Westinghouse being one of the main supporters of AC Current.
        Edison beleived that DC current would be ideal for America's electrical grid and in his design a power plant would have to
        be on each city block. Westinghouse on the otherhand would use transformers which could allow for AC currents to travel much further distances. 
        
        Things turned ugly when Edison claimed AC power of being extremely more dangerous than DC power. To demonstrait this he would   
        pay people to gather stray animals in public and would elctricute them. This culimnated to the first exucation in American history by an electrical
        chair which Edison assusered was powered with AC current.

            &emsp;AC current was decided to by the primary use for transfering power long distances in America. 
        This was extremely important to the allowing for people in ural areas. If the plan that Edison put in place   
        was used it would be impossible to power farms since each househould would need its own mini powerplant.
