GUI Assignment: HW5 Scrabble Game using JS
I was able to succesfully generate my scrabble board but I ran into issues when it game to trying to calculate the score
of the game. I think I took the wrong approach to my problem because I was not able to figure out how to get hte tiles
placed in the correct place. I think I could have a js script on the board image that would lock the tile into place
if I hoved over it with a tile in hand. After this I would be able to make calcs to find the score. I also
have a bug whenever I hit generate board a new one is created undearneath my currnent tiles
